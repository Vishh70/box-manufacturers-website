                <h2>Products & Pricing</h2>
                <p>All product prices displayed on our website are indicative and subject to change based on order
                    quantity, customization requirements, and raw material costs. Final pricing will be confirmed in
                    your custom quotation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All prices are in Indian Rupees (INR) and exclude GST unless stated otherwise.</li>

                <h2>Ordering & Quotations</h2>
                <p>Submitting a quote request through our website does not constitute a binding order. Orders are
                    confirmed only after written acceptance of a quotation and receipt of advance payment as per agreed
                    terms.</p>

                <h2>Quality & Specifications</h2>
                <p>We manufacture all boxes to industry standards and specified tolerances. Minor variations in
                    dimensions (±2mm), color, and GSM (±5%) are standard in corrugated board manufacturing.</p>

                <h2>Delivery</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delivery timelines are estimates and may vary based on order volume and customization.</li>
